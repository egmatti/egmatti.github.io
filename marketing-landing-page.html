      <h3 class="project-section-title">A free tool, a brand, and a fast-growing tech company in need of an introduction</h3>
      <p>Although OneTrust was named the #1 fastest-growing company by Inc. 500 in August 2020, the privacy management software company and its offerings are still a long way away from becoming household names. Much of what has fueled the startup’s early success has been the passage of first the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 and then the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in January 2019, each of which forced thousands of businesses to comply with new data privacy laws and regulations as soon as they went into effect.</p>
      <p>The new data privacy laws and regulations were a hurdle for large businesses, but one that they were able to overcome thanks to their many resources including their access to legal advice. Small businesses, on the other hand, were plunged into uncertainty due to their lack of resources, which might have helped explain to them what the new data privacy laws and regulations entailed. Their owners and managers took to the web in large numbers to find out what their businesses needed to do to avoid harsh government penalties as a result.</p>
      <p>It was partly because of this increase in the number of data privacy law searches that OneTrust’s idea for building a free <a href="/cookie-banner-wizard">Cookie Banner Builder</a> tool was born. The team that manages CookiePro, the subsidiary brand that OneTrust created to serve small businesses, decided that building a free version of the cookie banner and preference center wizard that already existed within the OneTrust app might be a useful way to introduce the wave of small business owners and managers searching for compliance solutions to CookiePro and privacy management in general. Because these small business owners and managers would most likely arrive at the Cookie Banner Builder by clicking on either an organic SEO link or a paid ad, the landing page that introduced them to the Cookie Banner Builder needed to introduce them to CookiePro and the benefits of privacy management software as well. When the CookiePro team asked me to design the landing page for the Cookie Banner Builder a few weeks out from its release, the multiple purposes for the landing page had to be top of mind.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Analyzing Content</h5>
      <p>Unlike some marketing teams, the CookiePro team was very engaged in their marketing’s site design. They always came to meetings not only with big ideas that they wanted to implement but with specific examples of layouts or components from other websites that they liked and wanted to emulate. When they delivered the content for a web page over to our web development team, they put the text and any images they already had in a table that was broken into rows for each section with screenshots of sections from other websites to use as inspiration. This made the process of sifting through the page’s content and determining the page’s layout much easier, but there were times when we had to break from the CookiePro team’s desired layout for a section.</p>
      <p>Using the CookiePro team’s content document for the Cookie Banner Builder landing page as a guide, I started reading through the content, looking at the section examples they gave, and thinking through my own ideas for the sections. The two other UI/UX designers on our team had recently designed a marketing site for a new offering within OneTrust that was devoted to Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) needs. I really liked the Products section of the OneTrust GRC site’s home page because of its ability to condense a lot of content down into a small area that was interactive and easy to understand.</p>

    <div class="project-subsection-text last-project-subsection-paragraph">
      <p>I wanted to take a similar approach with a few of the sections on the Cookie Banner Builder landing page since some of the sections contained multiple text blocks with accompanying images.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Wireframes</h5>
      <p>I started formalizing my ideas for the different sections’ layouts into low fidelity wireframes in Sketch. In a few cases, I had a particular idea for a section’s layout and then realized once I had created the wireframe that there might be too much content for everything in that section to fit within the layout I had initially chosen. I had the idea to make componentized wireframes—a wireframe of the overall page with alternative wireframes for some of the sections to the right of those sections—for that reason. I had already created symbols for some of my more simple wireframe elements, things like lines of text or images, and wound up creating symbols for some of the more complex elements as well.</p>

    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>I was happy with the wireframes that I eventually landed on and with this technique of creating interchangeable wireframes for particular sections, which I thought I might use again in the future.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Mockups</h5>
      <p>With my planned layout and the alternative layouts for each section in mind, I started working on creating the landing page’s mockup. I was a little unsure of how to style the page given that the CookiePro brand was going through a lot of change at the time. The CookiePro team had hired an outside agency to redesign their site a few months before I joined OneTrust and they weren’t exactly thrilled with the result. At some point I had found the agency’s design files and realized that the colors that were in the files weren’t the same colors that were being used on the site. I found out that the CookiePro team had decided to change their site’s colors and some of its other styles after the fact, which meant that the site contained a hodge-podge of different styles that didn’t go very well together and ultimately gave the site a somewhat dated look.</p>
      <p>Just a few weeks before I started working on the Cookie Banner Builder landing page, I had designed the initial mockups for the Cookie Banner Builder itself, which utilized a lot of white space to make the text and the preview image on the page feel bigger and more graphic. I started creating the mockup for the landing page with the idea that the landing page’s style might sit at the midpoint between the CookiePro home page’s blocky, color-heavy style and the Cookie Banner Builder’s lighter, more minimalistic style.</p>
      <p>As I started creating the mockup version of the wireframes I had created for each section, I also began to bring in some decorative elements to the sections that were inspired by the sections on the OneTrust GRC home page along with Sketch’s home page. I had already used circle and dot motifs on the CookiePro Knowledgebase article page template, which I had redesigned a few weeks earlier.  It felt like a natural extension of the brand to bring in decorative elements to the Cookie Banner Builder landing page that also used the circle and dot motifs.</p>
      <p>When I sent the completed mockup to our Lead UI/UX Designer and Director of UX & Design for review, they asked me to make changes to a few specific elements on the page, but liked the general layout and style of the page overall. The CookiePro Offering Manager was also pleased with the mockup and asked if we could make reusable components out of some of the sections on the page for use on other pages of the CookiePro site, which our Lead Web Developer was happy to do.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Mobile Mockups</h5>
      <p>Because the other UI/UX Designers on our team and I were expected to turn around designs rapidly and we were in the practice of using a reusable component library for the OneTrust site that was often rebranded and used on OneTrust’s subsidiary sites, we didn’t typically create mobile or tablet mockups for the pages we designed. The developers building the pages were expected to follow the mobile and tablet patterns used in the OneTrust component library and consult us for further advice when necessary. Our Lead Web Developer had no problem adapting the desktop mockup for the landing page to mobile and tablet devices for all sections except for the Compare Plans section towards the bottom of the page. The last phase of the landing page project involved the two of us working together to figure out the best way to modify the Compare Plans section for use on mobile devices.</p>
      <p>Although I had seen plan comparison tables that were similar to the one I created for the landing page on websites and marketing materials in the past, I wasn’t sure what a condensed version of the table might look like on mobile devices. I began to browse the pricing pages for popular software products in search of similar tables and eventually found a similar one on the Atlassian site.</p>
      <p>I liked Atlassian’s solution of converting the table into cards that listed all of a plan’s features in a bulleted list on its card instead of in a column. I sent screenshots of Atlassian’s plan comparison table to our Lead Web Developer and she said she liked their solution as well. I started creating a set of mobile mockups just for the Compare Plans section of the landing page that followed Atlassian’s table pattern.</p>
      <p>Although the solution that we came up with involved slightly more work for our Lead Web Developer than another solution might have, she and I were both happy with how gracefully the table was able to transition to a card layout on mobile. It was fun working together on this last stretch of the project and seeing the final result.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-title">A landing page whose components could be used again and again</h3>
      <p>While working on the mockup for the Cookie Banner Builder landing page, I had been worried that the page might not look like the rest of the CookiePro site or, alternatively, not look very appealing because I had adhered to the styles and components on the site too closely. Once the landing page was in development however, our Director of UX & Design told me that he thought we were moving the CookiePro brand in a good direction with the addition of this landing page. The CookiePro Offering Manager was also sincere about her request for us to build reusable components out of the sections on the landing page since she asked us to reuse some of the sections on the landing page on another page the very next week. With the completion of the landing page and the Cookie Banner Builder it was meant to introduce, it felt like we were beginning to get a firm handle on the privacy management brand that we really wanted to introduce.</p>
