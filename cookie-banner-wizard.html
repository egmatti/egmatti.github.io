      <h4 class="project-section-title">An enterprise application that was too complex<br/>for the needs of small businesses</h4>
      <p>OneTrust was founded in 2016 as consumer data collection was becoming far more robust and data privacy laws and regulations were starting to be drafted in different parts of the globe in response. Recognizing that protecting one’s data and giving consumers the ability to manage their own data was going to become a major initiative for companies both big and small, OneTrust set out to create a privacy management application that could be used by anyone and everyone.</p>
      <p>In just a few years, the start-up was able to become the world’s leading provider of privacy management software and was able to build on its platform to serve related needs. As the start-up grew and began to add more and more enterprise companies to its client roster, its application evolved to meet the complex needs of these larger customers. This left smaller customers feeling overwhelmed by the growing number of features they encountered each time they opened the app to perform a simple task.</p>
      <p>At the same time that OneTrust began to serve other needs besides just privacy management, they also began to restructure the company internally to revolve around particular markets. The CookiePro brand and team were formed to address the needs of small businesses who generally had fewer resources to dedicate to privacy management and data security. To remain competitive with other, smaller privacy management start-ups who had simpler and less expensive solutions, the CookiePro team began to build a variety of free tools for their marketing website that allowed visitors to perform a portion of the actions they could perform in the actual OneTrust app.</p>
      <p>Not long after I started working at OneTrust, the CookiePro team began to talk about ways they could bring their existing free tools together and expand on the number of free tools. They essentially wanted to create a central hub for all the tasks that a small business might need to do in order to become compliant with various privacy laws and regulations and asked me to create the initial user flow and wireframes for this “free edition” of the OneTrust app.</p>
      <p>After creating the initial user flow and wireframes for this “free edition,” however, the team decided to turn their focus away from bringing their existing free tools together and towards expanding on the number of free tools instead. They knew that one of the things that drew small businesses into becoming OneTrust customers the most was small businesses’ need to create cookie banners and preference centers for their marketing sites.</p>

    <div class="project-section-text">
      <p>The OneTrust app had a nicely designed wizard for creating customized versions of these cookie banners and preference centers, but, like many of OneTrust’s features, the wizard offered much more than the average small business needed or wanted. Because of this, the CookiePro team asked me to design a simpler version of the wizard for their marketing site that would act as a lead generation tool for the larger, more complex OneTrust app.</p>

      <h6 class="project-subsection-name">Early Ideation</h6>
      <p>Because the CookiePro team considered the time we had already spent working through the early stages of a “free edition” of the OneTrust app to be time spent on this smaller Cookie Banner Builder project, they were eager for us to create the mockups of the Cookie Banner Builder as fast as possible. Some internal discussions were had where we talked about modeling the Cookie Banner Builder off of another CCPA Opt-Out Builder the CookiePro team had already made and that I had recently redesigned. The CookiePro team was happy with that solution so we agreed that I would make an initial version of the Cookie Banner Builder mockups that utilized the same layout and styles as the recently redesigned CCPA Opt-Out Builder.</p>
      <p>After consulting with OneTrust’s Chief Technology Officer, however, the CookiePro team decided that they wanted to use a different layout for the Cookie Banner Builder that made the cookie banner and preference center previews more prominent. This more visual approach made sense given the simplicity of the wizard’s intended functionality.</p>
      <p>The CookiePro product managers were confident that they knew what their marketing site visitors needed and wanted out of this free Cookie Banner Builder tool and gave me a rough user flow to follow, which we together amended to include the following outlined steps:</p>

      <h6>Outlined User Flow</h6>

    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <img class="project-subsection-number" data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart" src="img/projects/subsection-numbers/subsection-two.svg">
      <h6 class="project-subsection-name">Sketches</h6>
      <p>From the outlined user flow, I was able to start thinking about how the layout of the wizard’s steps might be structured. I created a set of sketches for the wizard’s steps that placed the cookie banner or preference center preview in the middle of the screen and positioned the different cookie banner or preference center radio options, which would change what was in the preview when selected, below the preview window. While working at UserIQ, I had learned that progress bars provide valuable feedback to users who are making their way through the steps of a wizard because they allow the user to gauge how long it will take them to complete all the steps. I included a progress bar below the header on each of the screens in my sketches for this reason.</p>

      <img class="project-subsection-number" data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart" src="img/projects/subsection-numbers/subsection-three.svg">
      <h6 class="project-subsection-name">Mockups</h6>
      <p>After thinking about the pros and cons for each of the sketches, I was able to narrow down the number of viable options to just two concepts, which I converted into mockups and later prototypes. The key difference between the two concepts was that one concept had an additional tab in the tab bar for “Theme CSS” that would allow the user to switch to viewing the custom CSS editor for all campaign types and the other had a button group within the “Edit” panel that would allow the user to switch between viewing the WYSIWYG inputs for that campaign type and the custom CSS editor, which still applied to all campaign types.</p>
      <p>Using these sketches as a basis, I began to create an initial version of the Cookie Banner Builder mockups in Sketch. The CookiePro product managers and I had set up recurring “working sessions” to review our progress on the Cookie Banner Builder so, during our meeting on the following day, I showed them the mockups I had created so far. They liked the overall layout and style of the wizard, but wanted to explore slight variations on the placement of certain elements on the screen. In a true “working session,” we began to edit my Sketch file together with the two product managers telling me where they wanted to see certain elements go and with me editing the Sketch file in real time. We tried a few variations and discussed the benefits of each variation from the user’s perspective, eventually landing on a solution that placed the cookie banner and preference center radio options in a sidebar on the left side of the screen and a stepper element that would replace the progress bar on the right side of the screen.</p>
      <p>I spent the next couple of days polishing up the mockups we had created and then presented the finished mockups to the larger CookiePro team who approved them almost immediately.</p>

      <p>After making one final update to the mockups, we had landed on a solution that we felt confident in and that our engineering team was able to release following a three week sprint cycle.</p>

    <div class="project-section-text">
      <p>Within another few weeks, however, our Director of Software Engineering told our product team that the latest releases, including the Create Theme one, had improved the user experience in certain areas of our app so much that it would be worthwhile for us to spend a few days in a war room session determining how we could apply some of the new UX patterns to other parts of our app. After some discussion, JD and I suggested applying the two-panel concept and accordion pattern from the Create Theme flow to the Create Campaign flow, reducing some of the gaps within the overall process for creating a campaign.</p>

    </figure>
    <div class="project-section-text">
      <p>Although there was room for future improvements, we had found a way to reduce the number of usability issues within the Create Theme and Create Campaign flows within a short period of time, as evidenced by a drop in the number of Zendesk tickets that our CS team received around creating themes and campaigns. We had also done it without disrupting either the back-end of our application or our users’ workflows, making both redesigns a success for our company and our customers.</p>
