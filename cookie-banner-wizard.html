      <h3 class="project-section-title">An enterprise application that was too<br/>complex for the needs of small businesses</h3>
      <p>OneTrust was founded in 2016 as consumer data collection was becoming far more robust and data privacy laws and regulations were starting to be drafted in different parts of the globe in response. Recognizing that protecting one’s data and giving consumers the ability to manage their own data was going to become a major initiative for companies both big and small, OneTrust set out to create a privacy management application that could be used by anyone and everyone.</p>
      <p>In just a few years, the start-up was able to become the world’s leading provider of privacy management software and was able to build on its platform to serve related needs. As the start-up grew and began to add more and more enterprise companies to its client roster, its application evolved to meet the complex needs of these larger customers. This left smaller customers feeling overwhelmed by the growing number of features they encountered each time they opened the app to perform a simple task.</p>
      <p>At the same time that OneTrust began to serve other needs besides just privacy management, they also began to restructure the company internally to revolve around particular markets. The CookiePro brand and team were formed to address the needs of small businesses who generally had fewer resources to dedicate to privacy management and data security. To remain competitive with other, smaller privacy management start-ups who had simpler and less expensive solutions, the CookiePro team began to build a variety of free tools for their marketing website that allowed visitors to perform a portion of the actions they could perform in the actual OneTrust app.</p>
      <p>Not long after I started working at OneTrust, the CookiePro team began to talk about ways they could bring their existing free tools together and expand on the number of free tools. They essentially wanted to create a central hub for all the tasks that a small business might need to do in order to become compliant with various privacy laws and regulations and asked me to create the initial user flow and wireframes for this “free edition” of the OneTrust app.</p>
      <p>After creating the initial user flow and wireframes for this “free edition,” however, the team decided to turn their focus away from bringing their existing free tools together and towards expanding on the number of free tools instead. They knew that one of the things that drew small businesses into becoming OneTrust customers the most was small businesses’ need to create cookie banners and preference centers for their marketing sites.</p>

      <p>The OneTrust app had a nicely designed wizard for creating customized versions of these cookie banners and preference centers, but, like many of OneTrust’s features, the wizard offered much more than the average small business needed or wanted. Because of this, the CookiePro team asked me to design a simpler version of the wizard for their marketing site that would act as a lead generation tool for the larger, more complex OneTrust app.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Early Ideation</h5>
      <p>Because the CookiePro team considered the time we had already spent working through the early stages of a “free edition” of the OneTrust app to be time spent on this smaller Cookie Banner Builder project, they were eager for us to create the mockups of the Cookie Banner Builder as fast as possible. Some internal discussions were had where we talked about modeling the Cookie Banner Builder off of another CCPA Opt-Out Builder the CookiePro team had already made and that I had recently redesigned. The CookiePro team was happy with that solution so we agreed that I would make an initial version of the Cookie Banner Builder mockups that utilized the same layout and styles as the recently redesigned CCPA Opt-Out Builder.</p>
      <p>After consulting with OneTrust’s Chief Technology Officer, however, the CookiePro team decided that they wanted to use a different layout for the Cookie Banner Builder that made the cookie banner and preference center previews more prominent. This more visual approach made sense given the simplicity of the wizard’s intended functionality.</p>
      <p>The CookiePro product managers were confident that they knew what their marketing site visitors needed and wanted out of this free Cookie Banner Builder tool and gave me a rough user flow to follow, which we together amended to include the following outlined steps:</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Sketches</h5>
      <p>From the outlined user flow, I was able to start thinking about how the layout of the wizard’s steps might be structured. I created a set of sketches for the wizard’s steps that placed the cookie banner or preference center preview in the middle of the screen and positioned the different cookie banner or preference center radio options, which would change what was in the preview when selected, below the preview window. While working at UserIQ, I had learned that progress bars provide valuable feedback to users who are making their way through the steps of a wizard because they allow the user to gauge how long it will take them to complete all the steps. I included a progress bar below the header on each of the screens in my sketches for this reason.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Mockups</h5>
      <p>Using these sketches as a basis, I began to create an initial version of the Cookie Banner Builder mockups in Sketch. The CookiePro product managers and I had set up recurring “working sessions” to review our progress on the Cookie Banner Builder so, during our meeting on the following day, I showed them the mockups I had created so far. They liked the overall layout and style of the wizard, but wanted to explore slight variations on the placement of certain elements on the screen. In a true “working session,” we began to edit my Sketch file together with the two product managers telling me where they wanted to see certain elements go and with me editing the Sketch file in real time. We tried a few variations and discussed the benefits of each variation from the user’s perspective, eventually landing on a solution that placed the cookie banner and preference center radio options in a sidebar on the left side of the screen and a stepper element that would replace the progress bar on the right side of the screen.</p>
      <p>I spent the next couple of days polishing up the mockups we had created and then presented the finished mockups to the larger CookiePro team who approved them almost immediately.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Iterations</h5>
      <p>Over the next few months, the CookiePro product managers, developers, and I made several updates to the Cookie Banner Builder to drive OneTrust sign-ups and bring in some of the additional functionality that the cookie banner and preference center wizard had in the actual OneTrust app.</p>
      <p>One of our first initiatives was to find a way to inform the Cookie Banner Builder users of the additional features they would have if they utilized the OneTrust app to create their site’s cookie banner and preference center instead. We wanted to provide examples of the extra features that the OneTrust app had without crowding the Cookie Banner Builder’s interface and thought of a couple ideas for how to go about doing this. One idea was to show additional disabled radio options underneath the active radio options in the Cookie Banner Builder’s left sidebar similar to the grayed-out icons in Font Awesome’s icon library, which are only available with a Font Awesome Pro plan.</p>
    </div>
    <figure class="project-slider--medium-width">

      </div>
    </figure>
    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>Another idea was to present the user with a modal containing information about OneTrust’s additional features and a button to sign up after the user had remained on that step’s screen for a certain period of time. In order to convey the information about OneTrust’s additional features in a concise, visually-appealing way, I suggested that we make gifs for each modal that would display abstracted versions of OneTrust’s additional cookie banner and preference center options.</p>
      <p>I created mockups for a few different variations of these ideas and presented them to the larger CookiePro team. We decided to take a combined approach where each screen would show one additional disabled radio option that, when clicked on, would open up the modal containing information about OneTrust’s additional features.</p>

      <p>Another initiative centered on allowing users to add and use their company logo in their preference center’s header instead of having to use the default CookiePro logo. Drawing inspiration from an onboarding wizard that our Director of UX & Design had recently created for the OneTrust app, I edited the mockups for the Cookie Banner Builder to include a link on the wizard’s Select Style step that would allow users to add their company’s logo to their preference center. If clicked, the link would open up a modal with instructions on how to add a custom logo and then show a preview of the logo once it had been successfully added.</p>

      <p>The modals that I initially designed were a bit clunky with too much text above and below the logo URL input field. There was also some concern around the language we were using to describe replacing the CookiePro logo with a custom logo. In my initial mockups, I had used the word “upload” to describe replacing the CookiePro logo with a custom logo. The users wouldn’t actually be “uploading” a custom logo though since our developers told us they had nowhere to store users’ uploaded logos. They would be entering the URL of a page hosting their logo instead, which their site’s preference center would link back to.</p>
      <p>After spending some time identifying all the areas that might present usability issues with our team’s lead UI/UX designer and the main product manager on the project, I looked at how other products were handling similar interactions. A variety of actions in the Abstract app open up modals prompting the user to enter text into an input field or make a selection, so I spent some time examining the nuances of Abstract’s modal interaction design. I also spent some time reviewing Google’s Material Design guidelines for text fields since one issue that the team and I kept going back to was around how users would delete or remove their custom logo if the logo had an undesirable appearance once added. We talked about a few possible solutions to this problem and ultimately decided to place an icon on the right side of the logo URL input field that would allow the user to clear the input field when it was filled since this was an established pattern in Material Design. The revised mockups that I was able to make based on these findings were much clearer and more streamlined than the original ones.</p>

      <p>In addition to these updates, the CookiePro team wanted me to update the Cookie Banner Builder to include a user feedback feature that would help them better understand what users liked and disliked about the wizard and also be able to prioritize future work on the project.</p>
      <p>I had already designed a user feedback feature for the CCPA Opt-Out Builder that the team suggested I pull from. But after reading a few articles on best practices for gathering user feedback, I was certain that we could build something more useful and informative for the Cookie Banner Builder.</p>
      <p>One of the takeaways that I had from reading about user feedback best practices was that ratings on their own don’t provide much information regardless of the number of rating options. What does provide information are comments that can be parsed for repeated words. Uber makes tracking the overall themes in their user feedback even easier by requiring riders who give their experience four or fewer stars to explain what made their ride less than ideal by selecting from a variety of common issues.</p>
      <p>When I started exploring different ideas for the user feedback feature in the Cookie Banner Builder, I realized that a dynamic survey that prompts unhappy users to explain why they gave the tool a less than perfect rating might work best for the CookiePro team as well. Depending on how the developers decided to send the feedback to the CookiePro team, the CookiePro product managers could potentially filter or view metrics for certain issues within the overall user feedback.</p>
      <p>I created the mockups for this kind of dynamic survey and presented my work to the CookiePro team who approved it for future development.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-title">Integrating the free tool with the paid one</h3>
      <p>OneTrust’s Chief Technology Officer announced that he thought it was time for me and the CookiePro team to move on from the Cookie Banner Builder project after we had made the updates described above. The Cookie Banner Builder wasn’t getting as much online traffic as he and the CookiePro team had hoped it would mostly because the team hadn’t been able to expand on the number of regulations that the tool complied with just yet.</p>
      <p>Before putting any further development on the Cookie Banner Builder on hold though, the CTO said that he wanted the cookie banner and preference center wizard in the actual OneTrust app to become more like the free Cookie Banner Builder, which felt like an enormous compliment to both me and the product managers and developers I had worked with on it. At the beginning of the project, I had wondered if we should design the Cookie Banner Builder with the OneTrust cookie banner and preference center wizard in mind so that users would have some familiarity with the OneTrust app if they signed up for an account after playing around with the free Cookie Banner Builder. It seems as if the CTO had the opposite idea though since he wanted the OneTrust app to move closer to the Cookie Banner Builder and not the other way around.</p>
      <p>Even with the knowledge that the team plans to better align the two tools by making one flow mimic the other, I still wonder how they’ll eventually bring the two experiences together. When he stopped work on the project in June 2020, the two tools were completely separate entities. A potential customer could visit the CookiePro website, create a cookie banner and preference center for their marketing site using the Cookie Banner Builder, and then sign up for a free OneTrust account within the Cookie Banner Builder flow. But when they logged into the OneTrust app, none of their work from the Cookie Banner Builder would be saved and the app would look completely different from the free Cookie Banner Builder tool.</p>
      <p>I had previously heard our Director of UX & Design say that the goal is to eventually make the OneTrust app and the OneTrust marketing sites one and the same. This would make the OneTrust app lighter and nimbler like the web apps developed by the other privacy management start-ups that are competing with CookiePro for small businesses’ business. It’s hard to say where exactly the team will take the OneTrust app and the Cookie Banner Builder from here, but it was exciting to play a part in making some of the company’s services accessible to a wider variety of people.</p>
