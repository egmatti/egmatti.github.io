      <h4 class="approach-section-title">Good design starts<br/>with curiosity</h4>
      <p>When I was first introduced to design as a college student taking Graphic Communications courses and helping on-campus organizations with their events and publication design, I thought design was something based on feeling. I had received little art instruction at that point and didn’t know much about the history of design either, but I knew how colors and typography, photography and illustration styles felt and, for a very long time, that’s all that seemed to matter.</p>
      <p>That emotional instinct carried me through a graphic design internship at a marketing agency, which I seemed to excel at, along with a marketing role at a small ticketing software company where I was praised for helping establish the brand's look and feel. It even carried me through a User Interface Design bootcamp when human-centered design principles were staring me in the face even though I was too unaware to recognize them.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until I was working as a UX designer for an early-stage startup that that understanding of design began to fail me. When it came time to redesign a feature within our app, all I could see were the elements on the page, which to me looked just like all the images, copy, and effects that I had rearranged when doing countless ad resizes before. I could make a flow or page within our application look 10x more beautiful. I could clean it up so that the information was better organized and users didn’t struggle to understand what they were looking at. I couldn’t, however, look past the UI elements that made up the flow or page in order to see the larger picture of how that flow or page fit into our application or, more importantly, our users’ lives. I was a UX designer with only the toolkit of a visual designer.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <div class="approach-section-text">
      <p>My struggle to design new features for our company felt isolating partly because I didn’t understand it. It was only through a despairing search for answers in books about startups, user research, and working as a creative professional that I figured out that searching for answers <em>was</em> the answer. Reading about other startups that failed because they didn’t ask the right questions gave me the idea to take a step back from the UI elements I was scrutinizing and to question everything on the page, within our application, and possibly even in the way our company was doing business.</p>
      <p>I started to shift away from my understanding of design as a collection of feelings and instead conceptualize it as a series of decisions, all of which are based on answers to questions. If I wasn’t sure what our users needed, I could interview them or observe them (as long as I had their permission). If I didn’t know how to design a new feature based on what I found out they needed, I could draw from the collective knowledge of different people in our organization in an ideation session. And if I didn’t know if the new feature I had designed was actually useful, I could test it. Good user experience design, I figured out, starts with curiosity.</p>
      <p>Although I initially saw user experience design as not much different from graphic design, I’m now amazed by the opportunities that it brings. Once you’re free to start asking big questions, you’re free to start solving big problems.</p>
