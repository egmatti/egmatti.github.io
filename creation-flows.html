      <p>As an early-stage startup that was still in the process of staking out its position within the product management and customer success space, my former company UserIQ initially focused on developing three widely different feature sets in an effort to satisfy the largest number of new and existing users. The most popular and reliable of these three feature sets were in-app engagements—pop-up announcements, guided tours, surveys, and info bars—that other SaaS companies could use within their products to present information to or gather feedback from their users.</p>

      <p>Despite its popularity, however, creating a “campaign” was an enormous headache for our customers partly because they were unable to style their campaigns while creating them. To make their campaigns appear the way they wanted them to, they first had to go to a separate part of the app and create a theme that included styles for all campaign types before they could go back and apply that theme to the campaign they were trying to create. To make matters worse, the convoluted arrangement of theme options within this separate Create Theme flow meant that users were having trouble fulfilling the basic tasks of creating a theme.</p>

      <p>In order for me to better understand the problem, our Director of User Experience, JD Uchima, spent some time at the beginning of the project pointing out to me what he knew were the biggest issues within the Create Theme flow based on feedback he had received from the CS team. Two of the things that stood out were the scrolling tab bar at the top of the “Edit" panel that allowed the user to switch to the inputs and preview for a different campaign type as well as the placement of the custom CSS editor, which was currently hidden behind a misleading toggle below the save button.</p>

      <p>After getting a better sense of what was needed from my discussions with JD, I began to look at other apps with flows that seemed similar to UserIQ’s Create Theme flow and which our customers may have used before. MailChimp and Delighted provided good examples of how a few simple UI components, such as button groups, accordions, and a stepper, could be used to better organize this type of design wizard.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Sketches</h5>
      <p>Once I began sketching as many viable solutions to the problem that I could think of, I realized that the biggest challenge to redesigning the Create Theme flow was going to be figuring out the best way for users to switch to a variety of different views on the same screen. They needed to be able to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Switch between the WYSIWYG inputs for different campaign types within the “Edit” panel</li>
        <li data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Switch between the WYSIWYG inputs and custom CSS editor that advanced users were using within the “Edit” panel</li>
        <li data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Switch between desktop and mobile previews within the “Preview” panel and, in some cases:</li>
        <li data-aos="slide-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quart">Switch between different campaign type previews within the “Preview” panel</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One of the other challenges that I realized we needed to solve for was the random assortment of WYSIWYG inputs for each campaign type. The layout of inputs was disorganized with inputs for elements that would appear in the footer of the campaign being displayed above inputs for elements that would appear in the header. What’s more, users had the ability to change the styles for elements that were in multiple campaign types only on certain campaign types. It was obvious that we needed to determine a universal set of available WYSIWYG inputs with consistent naming conventions for all campaign types, but also include WYSIWYG inputs for elements that were unique to particular campaign types.</p>
      <p>The sketches that I initially put together reflected these two challenges and were inspired, in part, by MailChimp’s and Delighted’s creation flows.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Mockups, Prototypes, & User Testing</h5>
      <p>After thinking about the pros and cons for each of the sketches, I was able to narrow down the number of viable options to just two concepts, which I converted into mockups and later prototypes. The key difference between the two concepts was that one concept had an additional tab in the tab bar for “Theme CSS” that would allow the user to switch to viewing the custom CSS editor for all campaign types and the other had a button group within the “Edit” panel that would allow the user to switch between viewing the WYSIWYG inputs for that campaign type and the custom CSS editor, which still applied to all campaign types.</p>

            <p class="figure-description">If the user wanted to make edits to their theme beyond the available WYSIWYG inputs, they could click on the "Theme CSS" tab in the tab bar. This would take them to a special view with a CSS console. The user could input custom CSS into the CSS console that would then be applied to all their campaign types.

      <p>Our uncertainty about users’ mental models was the reason for the difference between these two concepts. JD and I had learned from the engineering team that any custom CSS that was added to the theme would apply to all campaign types within the theme rather than to specific campaign types, so we wondered whether it would make more sense to users if the custom CSS editor were in its own tab rather than in the “Edit” panel. We also wondered, however, if users would be more likely to miss the custom CSS editor if it were placed within the last tab on the tab bar.</p>
      <p>From a few hallway tests that we conducted with our coworkers who weren’t on the product team, it became clear that the custom CSS editor was harder to find when it was placed within the tab bar. It also became clear that users didn’t care that much whether or not the custom CSS for different campaign types was linked, alleviating any concerns that we had about confusing mental models.</p>

      <p>Within another few weeks, however, our Director of Software Engineering told our product team that the latest releases, including the Create Theme one, had improved the user experience in certain areas of our app so much that it would be worthwhile for us to spend a few days in a war room session determining how we could apply some of the new UX patterns to other parts of our app. After some discussion, JD and I suggested applying the two-panel concept and accordion pattern from the Create Theme flow to the Create Campaign flow, reducing some of the gaps within the overall process for creating a campaign.</p>

We had also done it without disrupting either the back-end of our application or our users’ workflows, making both redesigns a success for our company and our customers.</p>
