      <p>While its two target audiences of product managers and customer success managers were still defining their emerging roles within SaaS businesses, my former company UserIQ focused on developing an app that would provide a little bit of everything that it thought the two roles might want. This included a suite of product analytics, customer health, and in-app engagement features, the last of which would allow customers to build pop-up announcements, tours, and surveys that they could then present to their users within their own apps.</p>

      <p>As a follow-up to allowing customers to build these in-app engagements, which we called “campaigns,” the UserIQ app offered customers the ability to view the results of their campaigns on “campaign detail” pages. The campaign details were meant to provide deep insights to our customers about how their users were interacting with the campaigns, but, in many cases, they didn’t provide the kind of insights that our customers needed with the campaign details for custom surveys particularly lacking.</p>
      <p>After we had redesigned the process for creating a campaign and a campaign theme, our Director of User Experience, JD Uchima, decided it was time for us to direct our attention to redesigning the campaign detail pages and asked me to lead the way with our Custom Survey Detail page.</p>

      <p>To get started, I spent some time reviewing the idiosyncrasies of the Custom Survey Detail page and its subpages. The primary Custom Survey Detail page had a number of usability issues including the fact that the survey questions didn’t have results attached to them even though that was the purpose of going to the page and the survey questions were the only thing displayed on it.</p>

      <p>I had thought that the other campaign detail pages might contain other kinds of useful information that I could draw from for this redesign and, in some cases, they did. However, after reviewing the other campaign details as well, it became clear that the only consistent element across all the pages was a table of recipient information, which happened to appear on the question results subpages for the Custom Survey Detail. Having realized that there was little consistency across the different campaign detail pages in our app, I decided to take a look at some other web-based surveying apps to see if they could provide additional insights as to how to improve our Custom Survey Detail page.</p>
      <p>Even though its interface was overwhelming in a number of different ways, I spent a good amount of time exploring SurveyMonkey’s results view along with Google Forms’ results view. I was impressed by the amount of information that each provided me and was particularly impressed by both app’s aggregate response visualizations as well as their individual responses features, which, in both apps, allowed the survey creator to paginate through their survey results on a person-by-person basis.</p>

      <p>After reviewing UserIQ’s different campaign detail pages as well as these other surveying apps’ results views, I thought I had a pretty good sense of what kind of information users would find helpful on the new Custom Survey Detail page. Because I was eager for our product team to use Agile methodologies more in our design and development process, I formulated these things into job stories, which helped me better understand the value of each of the features I had seen from a user’s perspective.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Sketches</h5>
      <p>After compiling this list of job stories, I had enough well-formed ideas for what the layout of the new Custom Survey Detail page might look like that my sketches were essentially just variations of the same design. I wanted to utilize our app’s tab pattern again with more broad information about the campaign’s status and response rate appearing on the first tab and with more specific information about the campaign’s questions appearing on the second tab.</p>
      <p>I wondered whether I should move the visualizations that I was planning on showing for each question’s responses from the first tab to the second tab though since this seemed to be the information that users cared about viewing the most. As I explored in my second sketch, doing this would give me more room to include an individual responses feature similar to the ones I had seen in SurveyMonkey and Google Forms on the second tab.</p>

      <h5 class="project-subsection-name">Wireframes, More Sketches, & Mockups</h5>
      <p>While wireframing my two initial sketches, I realized that moving the visualizations for each question’s responses to the first tab probably wasn’t a good idea because there would be instances where users would create custom surveys with lots of questions and would later have to scroll down the Custom Survey Detail page for a long time in order to view all the results of their survey. I also realized that I had left out the table of recipient information, which I thought was an important thing to carry over from the existing campaign detail pages in UserIQ.</p>
      <p>Having come to these realizations, I started to sketch out a new design that placed the table of recipient information on the first tab, leaving the visualizations for each question’s responses on the second tab, and that also had the option for a third tab containing a version of the individual responses feature.</p>
      <p>After I had wireframed the new design, JD and I asked our Director of Software Engineering, Chris Morgan, if there were any data points in it that the engineering team wouldn’t be able to provide. He answered that it would be difficult for them to calculate the campaign launch date and number of days that the campaign had been active because users were able to pause and activate campaigns whenever they pleased. Thankfully for us, this was the only information in the new design that he had any hesitations about though.</p>

      <p>After getting a quick confirmation from our customer success team that the new design would resolve most of the enhancement requests they had received for our Custom Survey Detail page, I put together a checklist of things I would need to do in order to create the final mockups with JD’s input. In addition to removing the information that Chris had said the engineering team wouldn’t be able to include, JD suggested that I explore other options for displaying the free response data on the “All Responses” tab and for emphasizing the respondents’ selected answers on the “Individual Responses” tab. I took his advice and made adjustments to those features in ways that made them both much better.</p>

      <h3 class="project-section-title">Closing the feedback loop on users’<br/>custom surveys</h3>
      <p>Once the new Custom Survey Detail page was released, the feedback around it was largely positive with users now being able to see more in-depth information about who had responded to or dismissed the custom survey along with trends showing how those recipients had responded to particular questions.</p>
      <p>There was some confusion about which survey actions constituted a “survey view,” which I think we could have avoided if we had taken more time to perform user testing. For a campaign detail page that wasn’t offering many details before, our redesign was an improvement though and also helped pave the way for future improvements to the other campaign detail pages.</p>
